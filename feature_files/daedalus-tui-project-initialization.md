# Daedalus TUI Project Initialization

## Summary
The TUI can initialize a new Daedalus-compatible project under the launch root by materializing bundled templates (AGENTS.md, agent profiles, feature/parameter/topic directories, README, gitignore, and `.daedalus`), installing Graphify hooks, creating the initial Git commit, and optionally creating a private GitHub repository.

## Key Points
- **Launch-root destination**: The user supplies only a project slug and optional GitHub opt-in; the destination is always a direct child of the TUI launch root.
- **Template copy**: Initializer-owned files under `tui/templates/project-initializer/` are copied into an atomic temporary sibling, then renamed into place.
- **`.daedalus` scaffold**: New projects receive a TOML `.daedalus` with an empty `[worktree]` table (`install_command`, `readonly_paths`) so orchestration provisioning is ready to configure.
- **Recoverable requests**: A `.git/daedalus-initialization-request-id` marker lets retries recognize initializer-owned projects without overwriting unrelated directories.
- **Local by default**: Graphify install and Git init/commit always run; GitHub creation is optional and private.
- **Discovery refresh**: After success, the TUI rediscovers `feature_files` projects and switches to the new project.
